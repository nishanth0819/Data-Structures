#A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X. If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.
#Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
X = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The link list looks like
1 -> 3 -> 4
     ^    |
     |____|    
A loop is present. If you remove it 
successfully, the answer will be 1. 
#Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
X = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: The Linked list does not 
contains any loop. 


Code:
void removeLoop(Node* head)
    {
            unordered_map<Node*,int> mp;
            struct Node *p=head;
            while(p)
            {
                if(mp[p->next]==1)
                {
                    p->next=NULL;
                    break;
                }
                else
                   mp[p]=1;
            p=p->next;
            }
            
    }
